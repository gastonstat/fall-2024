### ðŸ“– About

What things should you pay attention when looking at a graphic?

How can you make a graphic less distracting from the data being represented?

In this unit we talk about the so-called __Data-Ink ratio__ (proposed by Edward 
Tufte) which is the proportion of ink (or pixels) that is used to present actual 
data compared to the total amount of ink (or pixels) used in the entire display.
