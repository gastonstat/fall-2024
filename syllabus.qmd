subtitle: "STAT 198, Fall 2024: Principles of Data Visualization"
---


## üìä Description

This is an introductory course to the principles of data visualization and their
applications with R. Topics include: 

- Role of graphics in a data analysis project;

- Grammar of graphics and its implementation with ggplot2;

- Use of analytical patterns/tasks to choose the right kind of graphic;

- Understand common color models and their relationship to human vision;

- Use of color with tools such as the color wheel, color schemes, color pickers, and color palettes;

- Designing principles (e.g. data-to-ink ratio, good practices, visual perception);

- Assessment of graphics (what makes a graphic good); 

- Animated and interactive graphics.



## üéØ Learning Outcomes

At the end of the course students will be able to:

- Explain the importance/need of visualizing data.

- Describe the framework of the grammar of graphics for creating plots.

- Use functions from ggplot2 and other packages for making graphics in R.

- Specify colors through the use of a color model, and its hexadecimal syntax.

- Demonstrate an adequate encoding of data with color.

- Recognize color schemes when inspecting a graphic.

- List five or more of the analytical patterns/tasks (proposed by Stephen Few) for choosing the right graphic.

- Apply and/or suggest changes that increase the data-to-ink ratio of a graphic.

- Assess the effectiveness of a graphic intended for reporting/communicating purposes.

- Produce animated charts as well as graphics with interactive elements.



## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Prerequisites

Because our main computational tool is R (and RStudio), it is desirable to 
have taken a course in which you got an introduction to R (e.g. STAT 20, 33A, 
33B, 133; PB HLTH 142). It is also nice to have some previous experience 
analyzing data. Being concurrently enrolled in these classes is also acceptable.



## üéì Methods of Instruction

We will be using a combination of materials such as slides, tutorials, sample 
scripts, reading assignments, live demos, and chalk-and-talk. 
In-class attendance is mandatory.
The main computational tool will be the computing and programming environment 
<a href="https://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank"><strong>R</strong></a>. 
The main workbench will be the 
<a href="https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/" target="_blank">IDE RStudio</a>.



## üìö Textbooks

The following books are not required, but will be referenced throughout the 
course for slides, assignments, and more. They can all be found online:

- _Data Visualization_ by K. Healy
- _Geocomputation with R_ by Lovelace, J. Nowosad, and J. Muenchow.
- _Now You See It: Simple Visualization Techniques for Quantitative Analysis_ by S. Few



## üìÅ Assignments - Homeworks

Homework assignments will give the students a platform to demonstrate and 
reinforce concepts covered during lectures.

HWs will generally be assigned every week.

You will submit your homework to Gradescope: typically your source file 
(qmd file), and the produced output (html doc).

You must write your own answers (using your own words, and your coding style---see 
Academic Honesty policy below). 



## üìñ Readings

There will also be weekly readings, mostly consisting of articles from 
_The New York Times_.



## üìÜ Attendance

Attendance will be taken daily.
In case of emergency, contact instructors for excused absences. You will still 
be expected to complete the class work from that date and email the instructors 
your work.



## üè´ Learning Cooperatively

With the obvious exception of quizzes, we encourage you to discuss all of the 
course activities with your friends and classmates as you are working on them. 
You will definitely learn more in this class if you work with others than if 
you do not. Ask questions, answer questions, and share ideas liberally.



## ‚òùÔ∏è Academic Honesty

Cooperation has a limit, however. You should not share your code or answers 
directly with other students. Doing so doesn't help them; it just sets them up 
for trouble. Feel free to discuss approaches to the problems with others, but 
you must write your own solutions. Please complete your own work and keep it to 
yourself. If you suspect other people may be plagiarizing you, let us know ASAP. 
For more information please read the <a href="http://teaching.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/general/hc_guide_for_syllabi.pdf" target="blank">Honor Code Guide for Syllabi</a>.

We expect you to do your own work and to uphold the standards of intellectual 
integrity. Collaborating on homework is fine and I encourage you to work 
together---but copying is not, nor is having somebody else submit assignments 
for you. Cheating will not be tolerated. Anyone found cheating will receive an 
NP grade and will be reported to the <a href="http://sa.berkeley.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Center for the Student Conduct</a>). 

If you are having trouble with an assignment or studying for an exam, or if you 
are uncertain about permissible and impermissible conduct or collaboration, 
please come see me with your questions. Rather than copying someone else's work, 
ask for help. You are not alone in this course! If you invest the time to learn 
the material and complete the projects, you won't need to copy any answers.



## üö∏ Special Accommodations

Students needing accommodations for any physical, psychological, or learning 
disability, should speak with me during the first two weeks of the semester, 
either after or during class and see <http://dsp.berkeley.edu> to 
learn about Berkeley's policy. 

If you are a DSP student, please contact me as soon as possible so that we can 
work out acceptable accommodations.

For relevant DSP accommodations that provide occasional extensions on assignments, 
we may provide a two-day extension as long as you contact us before the assignment 
is due. More details about these considerations may be discussed with the DSP staff.

If you are an athlete or Cal band member, please check your calendar. Do not 
take the class if you are not available to attend 90% of classes.



## üåª Safe and Inclusive Environment

Whenever a faculty member, staff member, post-doc, or instructor is responsible for 
the supervision of a student, a personal relationship between them of a romantic 
or sexual nature, even if consensual, is against university policy. Any such 
relationship jeopardizes the integrity of the educational process.

Although faculty and staff can act as excellent resources for students, you 
should be aware that they are required to report any violations of this campus 
policy. If you wish to have a confidential discussion on matters related to 
this policy, you may contact the Confidential Care Advocates on campus for 
support related to counseling or sensitive issues. Appointments can be made by 
calling (510) 642-1988.

The classroom should be a safe and inclusive environment for everyone. The 
Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD) is responsible 
for ensuring the University provides an environment for faculty, staff and 
students that is free from discrimination and harassment on the basis of 
categories including race, color, national origin, age, sex, gender, gender 
identity, and sexual orientation. Questions or concerns? Call (510) 643-7985,
