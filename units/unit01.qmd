### ðŸ“‹ About

In this unit, we review an assortment of data visualizations that we may
get exposed to---almost---on a daily basis.

We'll describe the type of graphics, introduce some basic vocabulary, talk
about the types of variables visually encoded. Also, you'll have the opportunity
to look for a handful of data visualizations about your data.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this unit you will be able to:

- Familiarize yourself with the vocabulary of graphical elements (e.g. geoms, labels, 
annotations, grid lines, axes, tick marks, facets, etc).

- Think about the structure of a hypothetical data table behind a given graphic.

- Identify the type of variable(s) visually encoded in a graphic (e.g. quantitative,
