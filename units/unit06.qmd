title: "6) Using Color"
---


### ðŸ“‹ About

In addition to color models (and their spaces), another important aspect of 
color has to do with its actual use when making graphics.

Recall that making graphics, conceptually speaking, is basically mapping data 
to geometric objects and their visual properties. One important property is color. 
Consequently we need to spend time talking about encoding data with color. 
Depending on the type of variables we are wroking with, and their associated 
measurement scales, colors can be used to encode such values. Therefore, we 
need to discuss which kinds of colors are more appropriate for encoding which 
types of variables.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this unit you will be able to:

- Understand the default behavior of `ggplot` when a variable is mapped to 
a color attribute.

- Indicate what color scale `ggplot` uses when you map a logical variable.

- Indicate what color scale `ggplot` uses when you map an integer variable.

- Indicate what color scale `ggplot` uses when you map a factor variable.

- Indicate what color scale `ggplot` uses when you map a double variable.
