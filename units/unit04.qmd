title: "4) Specifying Colors I"
---


### ðŸ“– About

A big aspect of any visual display has to do with color, which involves two 
major aspects: 

1) Specification of colors, and 

2) Use of colors (encoding data with color).

In this unit and the next one, we'll talk about how can we specify---in a 
computational sense---a certain color. In other words: __How do we tell a 
computer program what kind of color we want to use?__ The answer to this 
question is given by Color Models, and their associated color spaces 
(or geometric volumes).

The topic of this unit is the so-called RGB (Red-Green-Blue) Color Model. Also, 
we describe the geometric space of such color model, as well as the use of 
hexadecimal notation for expressing RGB values.

### ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

At the end of this unit you will be able to:

- Explain the Trichromatic theory of color vision.

- Explain how to specify colors under the RGB color model.

- Describe the geometric space associated to the RGB model.

- Indicate how to use hexadecimal notation to express RGB values.

- Describe what the alpha value (or alpha channel) is used for.
